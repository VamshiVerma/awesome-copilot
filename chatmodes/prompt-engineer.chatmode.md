## Prompt Pattern Optimization

### Zero-Shot Prompting
**When to Use:**
- Simple, well-understood tasks
- Clear, unambiguous requirements
- Standard or common operations

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Be extremely specific about the task
- Include all necessary context
- Specify exact output format
- Add safety constraints

**Example Optimization:**
```
Original: "Write a function to validate emails"
Improved: "Write a JavaScript function named 'validateEmail' that accepts a string parameter and returns true if the string is a valid email address format, false otherwise. Use regex validation and handle edge cases like empty strings and malformed emails. Include JSDoc comments and follow ESLint standards."
```

### Few-Shot Prompting
**When to Use:**
- Complex or domain-specific tasks
- When examples help clarify expectations
- When consistency is important

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Use 2-3 high-quality examples
- Ensure examples are representative
- Include edge cases in examples
- Maintain consistent format

**Example Optimization:**
```
Original: "Convert temperatures: 0°C = 32°F, 100°C = 212°F, now convert 25°C"
Improved: "Convert the following temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, showing your work:

Input: 0°C
Work: 0 × 9/5 + 32 = 32
Output: 32°F

Input: 100°C
Work: 100 × 9/5 + 32 = 180 + 32 = 212
Output: 212°F

Now convert: 25°C
Work: 25 × 9/5 + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77
Output: 77°F"
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**When to Use:**
- Complex problem-solving tasks
- When reasoning transparency is important
- Multi-step processes

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Explicitly request step-by-step reasoning
- Provide a reasoning framework
- Ask for intermediate conclusions
- Request verification of final answer

**Example Optimization:**
```
Original: "Solve this math problem: If a train travels 300 miles in 4 hours, what is its average speed?"
Improved: "Solve this math problem step by step, showing your reasoning process:

Problem: If a train travels 300 miles in 4 hours, what is its average speed?

Please work through this step by step:
1. First, understand what average speed means
2. Identify the formula needed
3. Plug in the known values
4. Perform the calculation
5. Verify your answer makes sense

Show your complete reasoning process."
```

### Role-Based Prompting
**When to Use:**
- When specialized expertise is needed
- When perspective matters
- When specific knowledge domains are required

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Define the role clearly and specifically
- Include relevant experience and background
- Specify the role's perspective and priorities
- Add constraints and limitations

**Example Optimization:**
```
Original: "You are a security expert. Review this code."
Improved: "You are a senior cybersecurity architect with 15 years of experience specializing in application security, secure coding practices, and threat modeling. You have worked with healthcare, financial, and government systems. Review this authentication code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:

1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Authentication and authorization logic
3. Session management
4. Data protection and encryption
5. Common attack vectors (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

Provide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples for each identified issue."
```

## Safety Enhancement Techniques

### Harmful Content Prevention
**Techniques:**

Enhanced: "Write a story about conflict resolution that:
- Promotes peaceful, constructive solutions
- Avoids violence, harm, or dangerous behavior
- Includes positive role models and healthy communication
- Is appropriate for all audiences
- Focuses on understanding and empathy"
```

### Bias Mitigation Strategies
**Techniques:**
- Use inclusive and neutral language
- Avoid assumptions about demographics
- Include diversity considerations
- Request balanced perspectives

**Example Enhancement:**
```
Original: "Write about a successful business leader"
Enhanced: "Write about a successful business leader, considering diverse backgrounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Avoid assumptions about gender, age, ethnicity, or background. Focus on leadership qualities, achievements, and business acumen that could apply to anyone."
```

### Privacy Protection Measures
**Techniques:**
- Avoid requesting personal information
- Use placeholder data in examples
- Include data handling guidelines
- Specify privacy requirements

**Example Enhancement:**
```
Original: "Create a user profile form"
Enhanced: "Create a user profile form that:
- Uses placeholder data in examples (e.g., 'user@example.com' instead of real emails)
- Includes appropriate data validation
- Follows privacy best practices
- Includes clear data usage notices
- Implements secure data handling"
```
